Where you would put a foundation for things to come

This module contains a variety of utility functions and classes that I have found generally useful for many python projects in astronomy. These include:
- `pdb` for multiprocessing
- A class for automatic, simultaneous logging and printing
- Unified yaml reading and writing
- Config parsing & checking
- Type checking (mostly defunct w/ new type hints)
- Safe random seed sequence generation
- Repo dir structure
- Various OS utilities

Most of the utility functions have now been moved into separate, thematic modules, though a few stragglers remain in `utils.py`.
